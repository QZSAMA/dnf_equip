dnf material updating for x char (so far its not dynamic and named by my own charId

CoreFunctions - main.py
UI - app.py

Require package:
PyQT5 - UI
pandas - csv updating
Tesseract 
pytesseract

Main propose: 
1.  Material recording and updating 
2.  from csv to DataBase (is it necessary?)
3.  Time recording of each runs (done)
4.  Reminding of equip buying in the NPC
5.  Machine Learning to classifing the material type and charcter class (base type)
6.  OCR from screen shot and extract the material amount and chacterId 
7.  mouse tracking / screen tracking of each motion of user and trigger the functions in the program instead of user updating

Current Issue:
1. How to crop picture into pieces for different single materials
